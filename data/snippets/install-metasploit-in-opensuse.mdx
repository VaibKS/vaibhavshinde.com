# Install Metasploit Framework in openSUSE

I'm writing this post since I couldn't find any resource related to this and I hope this would help someone other there! ;)

### Add GPG Key

This will import the gpg key.

```bash
$ sudo rpm --import https://apt.metasploit.com/metasploit-framework.gpg.key
```

### Add Repository

```bash
$ sudo zypper addrepo --refresh https://rpm.metasploit.com metasploit
```

### Install Metasploit!

```bash
$ sudo zypper in metasploit-framework
```

That's it, wait for it to get installed!
