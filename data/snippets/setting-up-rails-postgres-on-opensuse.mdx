After shifting to openSUSE, I had difficulties installing Rails and Postgres on my system, after searching for a while I found how to do it.

> **Note:** I am using Tumbleweed, so if you're using Leap, just swap the keyword from the commands as you normally would.

## Problems

If you faced these problems, chances are this would help you with it!
- Unable to properly install `rails` gem. The installation would succeed, but I could not run the rails command from my terminal.
- When trying to install the gem `pg` which is a Postgres module, I get an error saying the necessary development source files are not present on the system to build it. 

## The Solution

All I had to do was use `rvm` instead of `rbenv` and also install an additional package `postgresql-server-devel` for the `pg` gem to be installed!

### Steps

- Install `rvm` first as shown in [this article](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/20.04).
	```bash
	gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
	curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
	source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
	rvm install 2.7.1
	rvm use 2.7.1 --default
	ruby -v
	```
	To verify if the ruby and gem binaries are from rvm, run the commands to see their paths.
	```bash
	which ruby
	# /home/<username>/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.1/bin/ruby
	which gem
	# /home/<username>/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.1/bin/gem
	```
- Install Postgres
	```bash
	sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:database:postgresql/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ PostgreSQL && sudo zypper refresh
	sudo zypper in postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-contrib postgresql-devel postgresql-server-devel
	sudo systemctl enable postgresql
	sudo systemctl start postgresql
	```
- Finally, install rails!
	```bash
	gem install rails
	# or, if you want a specific version of rails
	gem install rails -v 5.2.4.3
	```

If you're still facing problems, try installing `libpq5`.
